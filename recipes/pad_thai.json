  "instructions": [
    "Add the oil to a large pan or large pot on high heat. Once the oil is hot, add the tofu and let cook until lightly crispy on all sides. Stir periodically, to avoid burning, but avoid over-stirring as this can break up the tofu. When crispy, remove from the heat and set aside in a bowl.\r\n",
    "Return the same pan to the stove on medium heat, add the 1 Tbsp vegetable oil. When hot, add the garlic, shallots, green onions, chili, and pickled radish. Cook for 5 - 8 minutes, or until the garlic is fragrant and everything is lightly golden. Stir occasionally to prevent burning.\r\n",
    "Add the rice noodles to a large bowl and pour over some warm water. Let sit to soften, and drain when 1 - 2 minutes away from being fully cooked. Rinse under cold water.\r\n",
    "When the garlic and onions are lightly golden, add the carrot, bell pepper, and cabbage to the pan and cook for 5 minutes.\r\n",
    "Add the soy sauce, tamarind paste, sugar, vinegar, sriracha, and lime juice and stir to combine.\r\n",
    "Add the rice noodles to the pan, and toss to combine. Cook until everything is warmed through and the noodles are fully cooked.\r\n",
    "Add the bean sprouts and return the tofu to the pan, and toss to coat.\r\n",
    "Serve while hot, top with desired garnish, and enjoy!"
